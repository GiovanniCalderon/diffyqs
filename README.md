Notes on Diffy Qs: Differential Equations for Engineers
-------------------------------------------------------

A free online textbook.  See http://www.jirka.org/diffyqs/

* diffyqs.tex is the main file
* diffyqssetup.sty is where all the preamble is
* diffyqssetup-tex4ht.sty is where the preamble for creating the web version is, but this is unlikely to work for anyone but me at the moment.  Also note that the google tracking code for my website is here, so if you want to use this you should change that first.

Figures are in figures/

Note: Some of the shell(.sh) and Perl(.pl) scripts here are really for me
and are really hacky ways to just do things.  Most of them are for generating the
web version.  Feel free to ignore them.
