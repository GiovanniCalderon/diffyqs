* Change name of first chapter to "First order equations" since we are adding a PDE section
* Change name of fifth chapter to "More on eigenvalue problems" as really eigenvalue problems have already been started in chapter 4

* Add section 1.9 on first order linear PDE and characteristics

* Make bottom margin smaller to save paper

* 3.1: Add linked tanks example
* 3.1: Add example for changing a second order system to first order system.
* 3.1: number all the examples
* 3.1: Define more of the terminology for systems
* 3.1: Split into subsections

* 3.2: mention det(A)det(B) = det(AB) since it makes sense when talking about invertible matrices, and is generally a useful thing anyway.

* 7.1: Add root test and an example for it.

* Renumberings: Figures in chapter 3, examples in 3.1, examples in 7.1 past
  the root test.

* Add exercises 3.1.6, 3.1.7, 3.1.106, 3.5.5
