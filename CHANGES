<li>After Example 0.2.1, add a short note about how the analytic solution
helped us find the parameters and how this is useful in real problems.
<li>On page 23, emphasize a bit more that if we applied the inverse function
theorem, we are integrating with respect to y.
<li>On page 33 in Example 1.3.1, explicitly separate variables before
integrating.
<li>In the Example in subsection 1.3.2, use \(D\) consistently
for the arbitrary constant.
<li>Be more precise to say that "singular solution" is the solution
that comes about because of the division by zero.
<li>In Example 1.4.2 at the very end,
explicitly say in
English that there are 11.86 kg of salt in the tank when full.
Also in the remark about concentration afterwards, write 0.1667 to approximate 1/6 to use the same
number of decimal places as the concentration.
<li>On page 58, add a displayed equations showing what the error is for
clarity.
<li>In 1.9, mention again the meaning \(u_x\) and \(u_t\) notation for
partial derivatives.
<li>Add "characteristic curve" to the index for 1.9
<li>On page 82 in the computation on top of the page add underbraces to make
it clearer what's happening.
<li>Resonance is a terrible example for a doubled root on page 86, replace
it with a reference to a critically damped mass-spring system.  Add a
remark about why two very close roots are bad (numerical instability).
<li>At the end of subsection 2.3.1, the reason why we want linear
independence was not explicitly stated so add Theorem 2.3.3 to have a
parallel with the three theorems from section 2.1.  It is mentioned in passing
in the next subsection, but this makes more sense.
<li>On page 96, explicitly say that \(t\) is in seconds and \(x\) is in
meters since we give the units of all the other variables, also we forgot to
say that current is measured in amperes.
<li><b>Exercise 3.8.15 part b) was changed to fix erratum</b>, the matrix given
was a typo that made the problem unnecessarily difficult and the solution in
the back was what was intended.
<li><b>Exercise 4.3.106 part f) was changed to fix erratum</b>,
we really wanted to ask about F(-9), so that we also ask for some point not in
the original range that's not the discontinuity.  The answer in the back was
in fact giving F(-9) as intended.
