* In 0.3, add the nonlinear pendulum equation as an example nonlinear equation.
* Also in 0.3, say a bit about difficulty of nonlinear equations, to give some
  motivation for why we study linear equations
* Also in 0.3, give the general form for an autonomous first order ode to
  drive the point home.
* Move Example 1.1.1 up by a paragraph as it makes more sense that way.
* In Example 1.4.2, explain where the \(2t\) comes up for figuring out when
  the tank is full, and emphasize that the concentration is when we divide
  by the volume, by the 100.
* In Example 1.5.2, note what \(F(v)\) is for clarity.
* Also in Example 1.5.2, note just before that since we have to avoid \(x=0\)
  we might as well assume \(x > 0\) or \(x < 0 . \)  Use \(x > 0\) in the
  example for simplicity and therefore get rid of most of the absolute
  value signs.
* In 1.6, add a short note about plotting \(y=f(x)\) to figure out the
  signs.
* In 1.7, tighten the language when describing first vs. second order
  method, leading to slightly nicer page breaks as a side benefit.
* In Example 1.8.7, in the final solution for \(F(x,y)\) we better put
  absolute values around \(y .\)  In a sense it is not wrong
  but we would require the complex logarithm otherwise. 
* A few minor clarifications.
* Several improvements in wording and fixes for grammar and style.
