<li><b>Change Exercise 3.1.106</b> to fix an erratum.  Rate of flow from tank 2 back into tank 1 should
be \(r-s ,\) otherwise volumes do not stay constant and the problem doesn't quite all make sense.
<li>Add a couple of minor clarifications to the end of Example 1.9.3.
<li>Slightly tighter spacing in 3.1 leads to a slight change (for the better I
think) in pagination in the section.
<li>A few minor clarifications and improvements in English and style.
