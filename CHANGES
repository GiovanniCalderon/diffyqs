<li><b>Change initial condition in Exercise 1.1.103 to fix an erratum.</b>
The previous inition condition meant looking at a point where the
differential equation is undefined.  While one can solve the problem
continuously, and the formal process just works, it's best to avoid it.
The initial condition is changed to $x(0)=\frac{\pi}{4}$ where the equation
is well behaved.
<li>In the processof fixing an erratum from Martin Irungu (a sign error in the
"proof" of Theorem 6.1.2; the final answer is off by a sign),  implement
Martin's suggestion to write the whole thing in therms of the positive $s-c$
rather than the negative $c-s$, which clearly leads to more typos.
<li>For some reason a new version of LaTeX is now making some spacing slightly
different (being a little bit more generous with space under figures for
example), so the pagination is slightly different in places.  I went through
and tried to get rid of bad page breaks by tightening up the language where
needed (a good thing to do anyhow), so it is only in a couple of places where
page breaks changed.
<li>Some minor wording improvements.
<li>Fix <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
