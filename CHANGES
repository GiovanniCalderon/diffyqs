<li>In Example 1.1.2, use \(t\) for the dummy variable to be
consistent with the discussion above.
<li>Be somewhat more precise in Example 1.1.6.
<li>Say a little bit more on why Example 1.2.1 is nontrivial.
<li>In Example 3.1.1, write out the equations for the
arbitrary constants.  This is the first example, it should be
as explicit as possible.
<li>Reword parts of Examples 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 to be more specific.
<li>In Example 3.1.4, add a short paragraph
to explain why \(x=u_1\) really is the solution to the original
equation.
<li>In subsection 3.1.4, reword the note about similarity to 1.6 and give
an explicit link to 1.6.
<li>Define what we mean by "square" matrix in 3.2.1.
<li>In subsection 3.2.4, mark "elementary row operations"
as a defined term and add it to the index.  Add
"row operations" to the index also for the appendix.
<li>At the end of Example 3.9.3, give the general solution explicitly.
<li>Just after 6.3.1, give both directions in formulas
for clarity
<li>In Example 6.3.3, reverse the order of the factors
as that's the way we write the convolution integral.
