<li>In Example 1.4.2, explicitly say how the volume is computed
<li>In section 1.9, terms in some equations were ordered with \(u_x\) first
and \(u_t\) second and some vice-versa.  Order them all the same for
consistency's sake, that is, \(u_x\) first.
This includes the exercises 1.9.1, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 1.9.6, and 1.9.101.
