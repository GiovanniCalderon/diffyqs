<li>Due to changes in LaTeX (namely the newpx fonts), pagination has changed
very slightly.  In the new version the theoremfont option seems to be buggy
so go back to regular punctuation in theorems and exercises, one can't even
tell.
<li>Reformulate end of Example 1.8.5 so that it's clear that at the end we
are talking about the corresponding \(M \, dx + N \, dy = 0\) equation.
Also note that \(x=-1\) itself is a solution to that.
<li><b>Change Exercise 6.4.5 to fix erratum</b>, in particular,
the the impulse response given is changed to \(t e^{-t} . \)
<li><b>Change Exercise 6.4.103 to fix erratum</b>, in particular,
the the impulse response given is changed to \(e^t \sin(t) \) and the
equation whose solution is sought is changed to \(Lx = e^t .\)
<li>Add Remark 6.4.2 after Example 6.4.2, which explains what's going on
with the \(x'(0)=0\) by noting that \(x'\) has a jump at \(t=0\) to produce
the delta function.
<li>Add footnote when defining the integral of the delta function that we
are always taking the endpoints.
<li>Make discussion of the radius of convergence based on the ratio test a bit more
readable.
<li>In 8.5 when talking about the Lorentz system attractor, be clearer by
explicitly saying that the solution tends to the attractor.
<li>Other minor improvements in wording and style.
