* In 0.3, add the nonlinear pendulum equation as an example nonlinear equation.
* Also in 0.3, say a bit about difficulty of linear equations, to give some motivation
  for why we study linear equations
* Also in 0.3, give the general form for an autonomous first order ode to
  drive the point home.
* Move Example 1.1.1 up by a paragraph as it makes more sense that way.
* In example 1.4.2, explain where the \(2t\) comes up for figuring out when
  the tank is full, and emphasize that the concentration is when we divide
  by the volume, by the 100.
