<li>On page 82 in the computation on top of the page add underbraces to make
it clearer what's happening.
<li>Resonance is a terrible example for a doubled root on page 86, replace
it with a reference to a critically damped mass-spring system.  Add a
remark about why two very close roots are bad (numerical instability).
