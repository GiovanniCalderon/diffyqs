<li>In Example 1.1.2, use \(t\) for the dummy variable to be
consistent with the discussion above.
<li>Be somewhat more precise in Example 1.1.6.
<li>Say a little bit more on why Example 1.2.1 is nontrivial.
<li>At the end of Example 3.9.3, give the general solution explicitly.
<li>Just after 6.3.1, give both directions in formulas
for clarity
<li>In Example 6.3.3, reverse the order of the factors
as that's the way we write the convolution integral.
