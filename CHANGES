* Change name of first chapter to "First order equations" since we are
  adding a PDE section
* Change name of fifth chapter to "More on eigenvalue problems" as really
  eigenvalue problems have already been started in chapter 4
* Use newtx fonts.  The changes should be minor, mostly nicer mathematics.
* Exercises with parts use the tasks package so they are not too cramped
  anymore.

* All floating figures/tables now have a gray border to better distinguish
  them from surrounding text, and all insets are on the right

* Add section 1.9 on first order linear PDE and characteristics
* Add section 6.5 on solving PDE with Laplace transform

* Make bottom margin smaller to save paper

* 0.2: Make the four fundamental equations a separate subsection, to
  emphasize and to make it possible to refer to it
* 0.3: Use a general form for the Newton's law of cooling, and
  name the old version exponential growth equation, which is more correct.

* 1.1: Add plot of 1/(1-x) to show the singularity
* 1.3: Add plot of an implicit solution
* 1.3: Add figure with a graph for the coffee example.
* 1.7: Compute the first two steps in the example with $h=1$ explicitly

* 2.2: Add a short footnote on the word ``ansatz'' and add it to index.
* 2.2: Make the $y''+k^2 y= 0$ an explicit example, so that we can refer to
  it, and give the version of the solution with sinh and cosh.
* 2.2: Reword the paragraph on why doubled roots rarely happen, so that
  the reader doesn't think it can just be dismissed.  
* 2.2: Add example of complex arithmetic
* 2.2: In Exercise 2.2.3 label the parts abc... rather than just bullet points

* 2.4: Improve the illustration of the pendulum including the forces

* 2.6: Add short note about what happens when the forcing frequency $\omega$
  goes to infinity.

* 3.1: Add linked tanks example
* 3.1: Add example for changing a second order system to first order system.
* 3.1: number all the examples
* 3.1: Define more of the terminology for systems
* 3.1: Split into subsections
* 3.1: Add the Picard theorem

* 3.2: Fix/standardize reduced row echelon form definition what we had allowed
  swapped rows.
* 3.2: mention det(A)det(B) = det(AB) since it makes sense when talking
  about invertible matrices, and is generally a useful thing anyway.

* 3.4: Rephrase Exercise 3.4.2 to be more specific.
* 3.4: For the complex eigenvalue/eigenvector equation mention that
  the bar of zero is still zero
* 3.4: After the complex eigenvalue theorem, write down explicitly the
  general solution for a 2-by-2 system

* 3.6: In Example 3.6.1, also solve for some initial conditions and
  add a figure of the result.

* 3.7: Add a quick example of a 3x3 matrix with defective a eigenvalue.
* 3.7: Add some extra explanation of what to do with algebraic multiplicity
  3 defective eigenvalues, and improve exposition on the higher multiplicity.

* 4.1: Expand slightly more on the linear algebra connection for
  eigenvalues/eigenvectors
* 4.1: Add footnote with the definition of sinh, cosh, as some students
  might be coming to this sections not having seen these (or not having
  seen them recently), and may have seen the solution in terms of
  exponentials.
* 4.1: Add another picture of whirling string for a higher eigenvalue.
* 4.2: Add footnote with reference to the examples where $x''+\lambda x=0$
  is solved.
* 4.6: Add small example where no series is computed
* 4.7: Add a little bit of intuition for the wave equation
* 4.7: Update figure of the plucked string
* 4.7: Add some discussion on what the solution says about the sound 
  of a guitar.  Also add some plots for fixed time of the shape of a
  plucked string.
* 4.8: make the verification computation easier by using the second form.
* 4.8: Add more comments on D'Alembert, why do corners persist,
  what about corners if we have to take second derivatives, and
  what D'Alembert says about influence of initial conditions.
* 4.8: Add hint to exercise 4.8.5
* 4.10: A few clarifications.

* 5.1: Add explicit expansion of x to the example at the end
* 5.2: Rename the section to "Higher order eigenvalue problems",
* 5.2: Add a footnote on the constant, and more detail to the derivation

* 7.1: Add root test and an example for it.

* 8.1: Add a short paragraph on what happens near noncritical points to
  really justify why we are looking at the critical ones
* 8.4: Add another example and a figure for a limit cycle.
* 8.4: Add example for not simply connected domain with a closed trajectory

* Add Section 6.5 on solving PDEs with Laplace.

* Add appendix A on linear algebra.

* Renumberings:
  Figures in chapters 1, 3, 4, and 8,
  Examples in 2.2, 3.1, 4.6, 7.1 (past the root test), 8.4
  Equations in chapter 4

* Add exercises 1.2.12, 1.2.106, 3.1.6, 3.1.7, 3.1.106, 3.5.5, 3.8.12,
  3.8.105, 4.3.11, 4.3.106, 4.6.11, 4.6.105, 4.7.8.
