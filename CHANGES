<li><b>Change initial condition in Exercise 1.1.103 to fix an erratum.</b>
The previous inition condition meant looking at a point where the
differential equation is undefined.  While one can solve the problem
continuously, and the formal process just works, it's best to avoid it.
The initial condition is changed to $x(0)=\frac{\pi}{4}$ where the equation
is well behaved.
<li>Fix erratum from Martin Irungu, a sign error in the "proof" of Theorem
6.1.2 (the final answer is off by a sign).  In the process, implement Martin's
suggestion to write the whole thing in therms of the positive $s-c$ rather than
the negative $c-s$, which clearly leads to more typos.
