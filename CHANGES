<li>After Example 0.2.1, add a short note about how the analytic solution
helped us find the parameters and how this is useful in real problems.
<li>On page 23, emphasize a bit more that if we applied the inverse function
theorem, we are integrating with respect to y.
<li>On page 33 in Example 1.3.1, explicitly separate variables before
integrating.
<li>In the Example in subsection 1.3.2, use \(D\) consistently
for the arbitrary constant.
<li>Be more precise to say that "singular solution" is the solution
that comes about because of the division by zero.
<li>In Example 1.4.2 at the very end,
explicitly say in
English that there are 11.86 kg of salt in the tank when full.
Also in the remark about concentration afterwards, write 0.1667 to approximate 1/6 to use the same
number of decimal places as the concentration.
<li>On page 58, add a displayed equations showing what the error is for
clarity.
<li>In 1.9, mention again the meaning \(u_x\) and \(u_t\) notation for
partial derivatives.
<li>Add "characteristic curve" to the index for 1.9
<li>On page 82 in the computation on top of the page add underbraces to make
it clearer what's happening.
<li>Resonance is a terrible example for a doubled root on page 86, replace
it with a reference to a critically damped mass-spring system.  Add a
remark about why two very close roots are bad (numerical instability).
<li>At the end of subsection 2.3.1, the reason why we want linear
independence was not explicitly stated so add Theorem 2.3.3 to have a
parallel with the three theorems from section 2.1.  It is mentioned in passing
in the next subsection, but this makes more sense.
<li>On page 96, explicitly say that \(t\) is in seconds and \(x\) is in
meters since we give the units of all the other variables, also we forgot to
say that current is measured in amperes.
<li>On page 105, add an explicit remark about trying a generic polynomial
even if some of the powers do not really appear on the right hand side.
<li>On pages 106 and 107, some of the particular solutions were just $y$,
but that's not totally consistent with the rest of the section.
<li>On page 109, the computation of the example for variation parameters,
rewrite the \(u_1'\) in a different way to make calculus easier
and use a different, somewhat simpler, antiderivative of the secant
(the one it seems the calculus books I have use).
Also be more consistent with not using parentheses after trig functions
if there is only one letter, it does seem a bit more readable this way.
<li><b>Exercise 3.8.15 part b) was changed to fix erratum</b>, the matrix given
was a typo that made the problem unnecessarily difficult and the solution in
the back was what was intended.
<li><b>Exercise 4.3.106 part f) was changed to fix erratum</b>,
we really wanted to ask about F(-9), so that we also ask for some point not in
the original range that's not the discontinuity.  The answer in the back was
in fact giving F(-9) as intended.
<li>On page 286, do not use \(F(t)\) for the forcing function as capital
\(F\) is used later in the d'Alembert solution so avoid confusion.  Also
explicitly use the words "forcing function" when we first talk about it
to make the exercises easier to figure out.
<li><b>Exercises 5.3.6 and 5.3.101 were changed to fix errata</b>:
As given, 1) the forcing functions would cause resonance and we didn't
really cover that and 2) they were given in x rather than t by mistake.
Both were changed to be on the interval \([-\pi,\pi]\) which avoids the
resonance and makes computations easier anyhow.
<li>In Theorem 6.1.2, mention the interval \([0,\infty)\) just in case
someone wonders what happened to the \(\frac{1}{t}\) counterexample.
<li>In Example 6.1.7, add an intermediate step in computing the unshifted
inverse transform.
<li>In 6.2.1, we offhand make a remark about piecewise smooth functions,
but if the functions have discontinuities, then one would have to
write a little bit more (the same procedure works, but does not get the same
formula as we'd be missing the delta functions in the derivative).
So just say "continuous" here and then the same formula will work.
<li>Replace Example 6.2.5 by a more intelligent one that also very simple,
somewhat easier to understand, and not as trivially solved without Laplace
(still easily though).
<li>Add short note about how one can compute \(H(s)\) without knowing the
equations, just knowing \(X(s)\) for a given \(F(s) .\)
<li>Add an extremely short subsection 6.2.6 on Laplace transform of
periodic functions, which seem to pop up in these courses,
and it makes sense in the same section as where we are looking at
piecewise functions.
<li>Add Exercises 6.2.13 and 6.2.104 on transfer functions from input and
output (this is similar to the exercise on the WeBWorK).
<li>Add Exercise 6.2.14 for a periodic function.
<li>Clean up wording for exerecises 6.2.12 and 6.2.103.
<li>On page 309 add distributive law to the list of properties of
convolution.
<li>In Example 6.3.4 mention that \(\frac{1}{s^2+\omega_0^2}\) is
the transfer function (and flip the order to be consistent
with the text before).  Then after the example mention how to get the
general formula from the transfer function, thus relating transfer functions
and convolution.
<li>On page 330, when writing out the Taylor series, mention that it
is a power series to drive that point home and also
expand a few terms as it is sometimes not totally clear what the \(k=0\) term
means here.
<li>Expand the first few terms of the differentiated series on page 331
to make it clearer what it looks like.
<li>In sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, add 0.5 lecture to the estimates in the
note for instructors, they were too optimistic.
I just did them each in 2 lectures and I felt it was about the same pace as
chapters 1 and 2 where I was hitting my estimates spot on.
<li>In sections 7.2 and 7.3, name the coefficients
\(P(x),\) \(Q(x),\) \(R(x)\) since lower case letters are used for
other things, most confusingly little \(r.\)
<li>In 7.3, a little bit more explicitly say in the beginning that we're
just trying to find a solution on one side of the singular point.  Also
mention the thing about what the singular point does to the initial value
in the first example.
<li>In 7.3 when describing the method, mention very quickly what to do
if \(x_0\) is not zero.
<li><b>Exercise 8.4.101 part c was changed to fix erratum</b>:
The system is changed to \(x'=xy^2,y'=x+x^2 ,\) and then the solution
in the back (changing \(y\) to \(y^2\) of course) works.
