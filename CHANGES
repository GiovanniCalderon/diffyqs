* In 0.3, add the nonlinear pendulum equation as an example nonlinear equation.
* Also in 0.3, say a bit about difficulty of linear equations, to give some motivation
  for why we study linear equations
* Also in 0.3, give the general form for an autonomous first order ode to
  drive the point home.
