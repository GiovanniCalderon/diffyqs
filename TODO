SHOULD (edition 6)

BIG(er):
* Add appendix chapter on linear algebra for courses that don't want to
  require that as prerequisite.
* Another section on solving PDEs with Laplace? (in the Laplace chapter)

SMALLER THINGS:
* Expand discussion of vector fields and how they are drawn in 3.1.
* More on the reduction of order method in 2.1 (and split into subsections)
* Add maybe a few more exercises for setting up applications in 3.1
* Generalized eigenvector discussion is a little too terse and perhaps still
  misleading.  Do another larger example perhaps.  Most of the exercises are
  3x3 so we should have an example of that.
* Add exercise for formulas for A^n in the matrix exponential section
* In 3.6 add more exercises on forced, and also improve the exposition wrt
  the units.
* In 3.4 (or earlier?) Add some exercises on constant nonhomogeneity for
  an invertible A, that just translates the point.
* In whirling string, plot several of the eigenfunctions to show how it crosses
  the axis k-1 times
* exponential order / type, need to use one term only.  Order at infinity
  also should be emphasized at more places.
* Include annihilator method at least in exercises of section of 2.5 

SMALL THIGS WHEN WE ARE CLOSER TO DONE:
* Double check the total number of estimated lectures

TECHNICAL:
* Update(check) EP references to 5th edition
* Update(check) BD references to 11th edition
* Change all exercise parts to enumerates
* Made pages larger as in realanal to save paper, but must check that
  the layout still work, especially inset floating figures might go bad.
* Double check all figures
* Use more underbrace / cancel (cancel only if really needed,
  it can look weird).
  See subsection 3.9.2
* Search for: will, previously, have, can, note, notice
* complex valued => complex-valued, vector-valued, etc...



IN CASE OF BIG CHANGE in the Star Trek future (incompatible edition):
* Split Fourier Series - PDE, probably move the "applications of eigen-series"
  to the PDE chapter.  In this case, first order PDEs might make sense
  before the second order ones since it leads naturally into d'Alembert,
  but they are in chapter 1, where they might make more sense.
* Add factorization idea in wave equation (d'Alembert) to write it as
  two vector fields applied to y perhaps?  Makes more sense if we have 
  first order before this.

MAYBE:
* Perhaps change name of \vec{x}_1 solutions to avoid confusion with x_1
  components, see what other books do

PROBABLY NOT/VAGUE:
* Perhaps an appendix with more info on existence uniqueness, linear
  independence (maybe wronskian, though perhaps it might be best to avoid
  wronskian, to avoid plug and play maddness), some proofs and extra
  information in general, basically some extra optional sections.  etc..
  Need more ideas for this.
