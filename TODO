SHOULD (in next big (but compatible) edition):
* More on the reduction of order method in 2.1 (and split into subsections)
* Add appendix chapter on linear algebra for courses that don't want to
  require that as prerequisite.
* Expand discussion of vector fields and how they are drawn in 3.1.
* Another example of application of first order system, perhaps flow with two
  tanks.
* Add exercises for setting up applications in 3.1
* Also split up 3.1 into subsections maybe
* Number the examples/applications (in 3.1)
* Generalized eigenvector discussion is a little too terse and perhaps still
  misleading.  Do another larger example perhaps.  Most of the exercises are
  3x3 so we should have an example of that.
* Add exercise for formulas for A^n in the matrix exponential section
* In 3.6 add more exercises on forced, and also improve the exposition wrt
  the units.
* In 3.4 (or earlier?) Add some exercises on constant nonhomogeneity for
  an invertible A, that just translates the point.
* Use more underbrace / cancel (cancel only if really needed, it can look weird).
  See subsection 3.9.2
* In whirling string, plot several of the eigenfunctions to show how it crosses
  the axis k-1 times
* Search for: will, previously, have, can, note, notice
* Another section on solving PDEs with Laplace? (in the Laplace chapter)
* A section on first order PDEs?  (Perhaps in chapter 1?? would need to change
  title to "First order equations" from "First order ODEs")

IN CASE OF BIG CHANGE (incompatible edition):
* Split Fourier Series - PDE, probably move the "applications of eigen-series"
  to the PDE chapter.  In this case, first order PDEs might make sense
  before the second order ones since it leads naturally into d'Alembert,
  unless of course they are in chapter 1 to begin with.
* Add factorization idea in wave equation (d'Alembert) to write it as
  two vector fields applied to y perhaps?  Makes more sense if we have 
  first order before this.

MAYBE:
* Perhaps change name of \vec{x}_1 solutions to avoid confusion with x_1
  components, see what other books do
* Include annihilator method at least in exercises of section of 2.5 
* exponential order / type, need to use one term only.  Order at infinity
  also should be emphasized at more places.
* Root test for power series?  Are we just adding too much to 7.1?

PROBABLY NOT/VAGUE:
* Perhaps an appendix with more info on existence uniqueness, linear
  independence (maybe wronskian, though perhaps it might be best to avoid
  wronskian, to avoid plug and play maddness), some proofs and extra
  information in general, basically some extra optional sections.  etc..
  Need more ideas for this.


DONE:
* Add Dirac delta function to chapter 6 such as chapter 6.5 in [BD]
* Should mention that transfer functions are impulse response, may be
  connected to adding delta function.
